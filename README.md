# SpringMVCDemo
This is a demo of my spring mvc tutorial project.

To watch the whole tutorial, please go to [Gaussic OSChina](http://my.oschina.net/gaussik/blog/385697)

To run this project, you should create a databa called springdemo, and import springdemo.sql into it.

Better use the newest version of IntelliJ IDEA, and JDK 1.7_x, Tomcat 7.x

If you have any questions, you can create issues here.
